## Experience  

### **Undergraduate Researcher** (_Jan 2022 – Dec 2024_)  
- **Mental Health Prediction Model**  
  Developed a predictive system for college students' mental health using sociodemographic and Quality of Life data.  
  - Built and tested multiple machine learning techniques, achieving **82.62% accuracy** and an **R² of 0.7139**.  
  - Utilized feature selection methods like SBFS and SFFS to improve model performance.  
  - Analyzed data from 880 participants using the MHI, WHOQOL-Bref, and sociodemographic forms, identifying critical factors influencing mental health.  

- **ECG Signal Classification for Atrial Fibrillation Detection**  
  Researched the application of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and traditional ML models for ECG signal classification.  
  - Implemented tensor decomposition techniques for signal preprocessing.  
  - Achieved an **F1-score of 0.9647**, optimizing models through advanced hyperparameter tuning and signal processing.  

### **Research Intern** (_2024_)  
- Designed and developed an **extremely lightweight CNN model** (720 KB) outperforming models as large as 250 MB.  
  - Delivered state-of-the-art accuracy while minimizing computational and memory requirements, making the model ideal for resource-constrained devices.
